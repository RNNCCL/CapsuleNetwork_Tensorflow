# CapsuleNetwork_Tensorflow
A Tensorflow implementation of Capsules Network in Hinton's paper of Dynamic Routing Between Capsules.

## Introduction
* Recently Mr Hinton showed his new paper of Dynamic Routing Between Capsules, which would subvert traditional neural nets, and I agree with him.

## Support
* Capsule network is based on [CapsNet-Tensorflow](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow), where you can update it.
* However I added others into the project.

## Requirements
* Python
* NumPy
* [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
* tqdm (for displaying training progress info)
* scipy (for saving images)

## Usage
* Scripts
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/avBuffer/CapsuleNetwork_Tensorflow.git
cd CapsuleNetwork_Tensorflow
python src/main.py
```
* Also import the project into Eclipse, such as "File->Import->General/Existing Projects into Workspace". But you should install PyDev in Eclipse.

## Issues
* If you have any idea or issues, please keep me informed.
* My Email: jalymo at 126.com, and my QQ/Wechat: 345238818

## Wechat&QQ group 
* I setup VoAI Wechat group, which discusses AI/DL/ML/NLP.
* VoAI means Voice of AI, Vision of AI, Visualization of AI etc.
* You can joint VoAI Wechat group by scanning ![QR-code](https://github.com/avBuffer/caffe_ssd-android-lib/tree/master/imgs/VoAI.png) in path ./imgs/VoAI.jpg.
* Also you can joint QQ group ID: 183669028

Any comments or issues are also welcomed.Thanks!
